"Due to incorrect reporting by sector, the sector allocations for small scale solar have been estimated for February 2018.
NM = Not Meaningful due to large relative standard error or excessive percentage change.
These estimates are for small-scale PV units less than 1 MW that are not reported on the form EIA-860",,,,,,,,,,,
